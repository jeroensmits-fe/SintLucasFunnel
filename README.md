# SintLucas Funnel

## Setup

Before we start we have to do the following steps:

1. Create a new Github repo
2. Optional: setup versioning with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
3. In the new folder we will start with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

> npm create vite@latest

<i>Fill in a project name</i>
<i>We will start with the vanilla framework, not vanilla-ts</i>

4. Go to the new folder and run <i>npm install</i>

> $ cd ./{project-name}

> $ npm install

5. Commit this setup to the repository

## Design

There is a [design](https://zpl.io/o1n8vmG) that we can use for building the funnel.
