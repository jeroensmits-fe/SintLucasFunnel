# SintLucas Funnel

## What do we do?

- [ ] Building page semantically with HTML according to guidelines
- [ ] Mobile first styling of the page
- [ ] Making elements interactive with Javascript
- [ ] You can convert CSS to a library such as postcss/scss
- [ ] Work must be added to portfolio
- [ ] Present your work to other developers

## Setup

Before we start we have to do the following steps:

1. Create a new Github repo
2. Optional: setup versioning with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
3. In the new folder we will start with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

> npm create vite@latest

<i>Fill in a project name</i>
<i>We will start with the vanilla framework, not vanilla-ts</i>

4. Go to the new folder and run <i>npm install</i>

> $ cd ./{project-name}

> $ npm install

5. Commit this setup to the repository

## Design

There is a [design](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/6254854ab3f4666ab11c6842) that we can use for building the funnel.
